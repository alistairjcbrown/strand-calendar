# üìÜ Strand Calendar

‚ö†Ô∏è **This code is no longer running** - there will be no new releases published.
Previously published releases will remain, but data in the last versions
published may be incorrect.

The Strand Cinema has recently updated their website layout, which has broken
the scripts in this repo from running correctly. They are also due to close for
an extended period of time for refusbishment, at the end of June 2024.

Due to this, no updates will be made to the scripts in this repository, and the
cronjob that generates releases will instead be turned off. This decision may be
revisited again in the future, but while this notice is in place consider the
repository to be abandoned.
